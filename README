It's a twitter bot that posts random photos with captions.

1: Setup a recurring cron job to call 

	`python main.py -q`, which pulls from the queue.

   The queue is stored in queue/

2: Make sure to put your twitter account in the code. I've made it throw an error so you remember.

3: The captions are pulled from "comments-clean.txt". You can change this.

4: To actually add things to the queue or post, use
	
	`python main.py -i`

   You'll be presented with a candidate image.
   Type `y` to post immediately, `q` to queue, or anything else to skip. You'll be prompted to delete the photo, too.

5: The stock photos are pulled from the internet, using 'unsplash's API for random images. Not sure why this API
exists, but it's a good fit for this task.
